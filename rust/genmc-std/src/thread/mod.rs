//! This file provides implementations for spawning and joining
//! threads using GenMC. The implementation is strongly modelled
//! after the implementation in Rusts STD. Spawning / Joining
//! fullfills the same type requirements as in Rusts STD, thus
//! this can be easily swapped in for checking preexisting code.
//! Yielding and Sleeping are no-ops in this implementation.
//!
//! It includes a light-weight alternatives for spawning threads
//! using functions instead of closures: spawn_f & spawn_f_args.
//!
//! Some additional, non-STD helper functions were added for JoinHandle:
//! - Join Non-Consuming
//! - Join by Thread ID
//! - Get Thread ID
//! - Create a Dummy-JoinHandle
