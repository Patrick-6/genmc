//! This file provides implementations for spawning and joining scoped
//! threads using GenMC. The implementation is strongly modelled after
//! the implementation in Rusts STD. We count the number of running threads
//! and return when that counter reaches 0. We use __VERIFIER_assume for that
//! instead of the busy-waiting used in Rusts STD.
//! 
//! Scoped threads have two lifetimes: 'env and 'scope
//! 'scope: Lifetime during which scoped threads may still be running
//! and new threads may still be spawned. It ends when all scoped threads
//! are joined.
//! 'env: Lifetime of everything borrowed by threads in the scope. It must
//! outlast the lifetime of 'scope.
